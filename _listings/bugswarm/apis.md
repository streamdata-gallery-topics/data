description: Acquire data from and control embedded devices using JavaScript or plain
  old HTTP. Combine multiple resources together to create a swarm. Once a member of
  a swarm, a resource can communicate and share data with other resources in that
  swarm. Control the level of access a resource has to a swarm. Grant a resource permission
  to produce data, consume data, or do both. Invite another users resources into your
  swarms and accept invitations to place your resources in somebody elses swarms.
  Share your data easily and securely.
