name: Dropbox
description: Dropbox is a file hosting service operated by Dropbox, Inc., that offers
  cloud storage, file synchronization, and client software. Dropbox allows users to
  create a special folder on each of their computers, which Dropbox then synchronizes
  so that it appears to be the same folder (with the same contents) regardless of
  which computer is used to view it. Files placed in this folder also are accessible
  through a website and mobile phone applications.
