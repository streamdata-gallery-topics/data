name: AWS Snowball
description: Snowball is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure
  appliances tonbsp;transfer large amounts of datanbsp;into and out of thenbsp;AWS
  cloud. Using Snowball addresses common challenges with large-scale data transfers
  including high network costs, long transfer times, and security concerns. Transferring
  data with Snowball is simple, fast, secure, and can be as little as one-fifth the
  cost of high-speed Internet.nWith Snowball, you donrsquo;t need to write any code
  or purchase any hardware to transfer your data. Simply create a job in the AWS Management
  Console and a Snowball appliance will be automatically shipped to you*. Once it
  arrives, attach the appliance to your local network, download and run the Snowball
  client to establish a connection, and then use the client to select the file directories
  that you want to transfer to the appliance. The client will then encrypt and transfer
  the files to the appliance at high speed. Once the transfer is complete and the
  appliance is ready to be returned, the E Ink shipping label will automatically update
  and you can track the job status vianbsp;Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS),
  text messages, or directly in the Console.nSnowball uses multiple layers of security
  designed to protect your data including tamper-resistant enclosures, 256-bit encryption,
  and an industry-standard Trusted Platform Module (TPM) designed to ensure both security
  and full chain-of-custody of your data. Once the data transfer job has been processed
  and verified, AWS performs a software erasure of the Snowball appliance.
