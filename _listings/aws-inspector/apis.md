  improve the security and compliance of applications deployed on AWS. Amazon Inspector
  automatically assesses applications for vulnerabilities or deviations from best
  practices. After performing an assessment, Amazon Inspector produces a detailed
  list of security findings prioritized by level of severity.nTo help you get started
  quickly, Amazon Inspector includes a knowledge base of hundreds of rules mapped
  to common security best practices and vulnerability definitions. Examples of built-in
  rules include checking for remote root login being enabled, or vulnerable software
  versions installed. These rules are regularly updated by AWS security researchers.
