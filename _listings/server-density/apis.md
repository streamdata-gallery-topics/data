  description: |-
    Get the alerts history items limited by the given filter. If configId filter is set, then the results contains all events for that alert configuration. In any other case, the results are aggregated by itemId and configId including the following derived values:

    duration the sum of event durations.
    triggeredCount the number of events for that alert in that item.
    cost the HumanOps cost in seconds. For more information please check our support docs


    When the query is aggregated, the non-derived fields are from the document whose startDate is the newest. In addition to this, an unique id is generated by concatenating the itemId and the configId.
