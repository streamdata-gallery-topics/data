description: DataMade is a civic technology company. We build open source technology
  using open data to empower journalists, researchers, governments and advocacy organizations.
  DataMade was born out of Chicagos Open Government community. In 2011, Derek and
  Forest started working on civic technology as volunteers of Open City. At nights
  and over weekends, theyve helped make civic apps like Chicago Lobbyists, Clear Streets,
  and Second City Zoning.
