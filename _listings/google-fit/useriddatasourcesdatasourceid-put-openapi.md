      description: Creates a new data source that is unique across all data sources
        belonging to this user. The data stream ID field can be omitted and will be
        generated by the server with the correct format. The data stream ID is an
        ordered combination of some fields from the data source. In addition to the
        data source fields reflected into the data source ID, the developer project
        number that is authenticated when creating the data source is included. This
        developer project number is obfuscated when read by any other developer reading
        public data types.
