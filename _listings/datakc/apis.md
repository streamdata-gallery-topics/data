description: Crowdtilt allows groups to pool funds for objectives in a simple, social,
  and frictionless way online.We all love doing things as a group. Like with a lot
  of experiences, it&#8217;s not what you do ??? it&#8217;s the people you do it with
  that matters more.At Crowdtilt, we&#8217;re trying to make it easier for groups
  to do things together. Whether it&#8217;s a party-bus to the next Phish show or
  pooling money for a cause you know your close friends are passionate about ??? we
  just want to make that process of grouping those funds as easy as possible.
