description: Amazon Machine Learning is a service that makes it easy for developers
  of all skill levels to use machine learning technology. Amazon Machine Learning
  provides visualization tools and wizards that guide you through the process of creating
  machine learning (ML) models without having to learn complex ML algorithms and technology.
  Once your models are ready, Amazon Machine Learning makes it easy to obtain predictions
  for your application using simple APIs, without having to implement custom prediction
  generation code, or manage any infrastructure.Amazon Machine Learning is based on
  the same proven, highly scalable, ML technology used for years by Amazon&rsquo;s
  internal data scientist community. The service uses powerful algorithms to create
  ML models by finding patterns in your existing data. Then, Amazon Machine Learning
  uses these models to process new data and generate predictions for your application.Amazon
  Machine Learning is highly scalable and can generate billions of predictions daily,
  and serve those predictions in real-time and at high throughput. With Amazon Machine
  Learning, there is no upfront hardware or software investment, and you pay as you
  go, so you can start small and scale as your application grows.
