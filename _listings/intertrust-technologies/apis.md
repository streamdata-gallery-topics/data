description: 'A new reality is emerging as we adjust to the world where sensors on
  everything &mdash; from phones to cars to medical devices &mdash; track every movement,
  every blink of the eye, every heartbeat and location. Troves of data are being collected,
  governed, and analyzed in quantities hitherto unfathomable. These data can help
  us live longer and be better informed about our interests and dislikes. They can
  also keep us better connected and more entertained. Yet, significant technological
  and social issues exist around how these data should be properly handled. An outmoded
  regulatory environment and an increasingly lucrative market for digital profiles
  have formed a potent cocktail, rendering our information increasingly vulnerable
  to those who wish to exploit it. A boundless world awaits, but specific safeguards
  must be taken to protect personal and societal interests. With its years of research
  and development in trusted distributed computing, networked security, and social
  computing, Intertrust is up to this evermore important challenge: To build trust
  in a connected world.'
